 D3-Challenge
 
 A scatter plot was created between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

Using the D3 techniques the scatter plot  represents each state with circle elements. The code for this graphic located  in the app.js file  directory pulls in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. 
State abbreviations are in the circles and axes and label are to the left and bottom of the chart.



Note: You'll need to use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
